# Advent of Code 2023

This is my attempt at Advent of Code 2023.
I take this as an opportunity to learn Clojure, on Day 1 I only knew basic syntax and a few functions.
The hope is that the code gets better as the Christmas day approaches.

The `dayX.clj` file contains the code as I run it successfully the first time.
Sometimes I try to clean up the code in the `dayX-tidy.clj`, but life gets in a way.
