# Advent of Code 2023

This is my attempt at Advent of Code 2023.
I am using this as a way to learn Clojure, on Day 1 I only knew basic syntax and few function.

The `dayX.clj` file contains the code as I run it successfully the first time.
Sometimes I try to clean up the code in the `dayX-tidy.clj`
